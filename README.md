HTML,CSS, and Bootstraps were used to create a visualization dashboard website to display the analysis from a previous assignments on plotting weahter data. 
The dashboard was created with individual pages for each plot and a means to navigate between them. The pages have visualizations with corresponding explantations. There's a landing page, where we can see a comparison of all of the plots and a page for each plot.


Website consists of 7 pages total.
